# Product-Review-Analyzer
Product Review Analyzer is a Python tool that scrapes reviews from Amazon and Flipkart, collecting ratings, reviewer names, dates, and review text. It uses Selenium for automation, stores data in CSV, and analyzes reviews via Gemini CLI, providing overall impressions, positive/negative summaries, and real-time progress in a Tkinter GUI.
